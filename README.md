# Getting Started
## Overview
This Comprehend Immersion Day provides customers with hands-on experience with Amazon Comprehend demonstrating how they can build natural language processing (NLP) use cases, and is specifically designed to help us accelerate a customer opportunity.

After attending a Comprehend Immersion Day, customers would be able to leverage the service to extract insights and relationships in text. They will be able to address a number of use cases around extraction of entities and key phrases, detecting sentiment and syntax, detecting and redacting personally identifiable information (PII) using NLP, train Comprehend to detect entities specific to their business or to classify documents to assign classes that are relevant to their use cases

## AWS Accounts
For running an Immersion Day where you need to use your own AWS accounts. Follow the below best practices:

Use a AWS account that is not running production systems.
Any accounts should be created a minimum of three days ahead of time. It takes time for new accounts to be completely ready, payment methods to be confirmed, and limits to be set.
